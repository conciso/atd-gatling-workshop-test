# Agile Testing Days 2021 Gatling Workshop Tests
Test project with the start skeleton code and the solutions for our Gatling workshop @ Agile Testing Days 2021.

## Start of test skeleton
```shell
mvn clean verify
```

The code will be compiled and the base simulation outside of the solution
folders will be started. Participants of the workshop can develop the
solutions based on that skeleton to create their own solution.
